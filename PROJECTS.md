# Projects
This is where I have all of my past projects I have accomplished

## Computer Science 1 Final Project
- For my Computer Science 1 final, I created a code with multiple classes that demonstrated how ray casting works
- Comprised of 4 different class: "main," "Panel," "Player," and "Walls"
- After running the code, a seperate window opens that shows ray casting in full effect!

## Mandelbrot Set
- I created a code that would create a mandelbrot image and send it to a file to be able to be opened.
- Composed of 3 different classes, each handling different situations.
